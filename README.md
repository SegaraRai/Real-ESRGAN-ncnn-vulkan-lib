# upsclr-plugin-ncnn-vulkan

This is a super-resolution plugin for Upsclr using the ncnn and Vulkan backend.

Currently, it supports the following algorithms:

- [Real-CUGAN](https://github.com/nihui/realcugan-ncnn-vulkan)
- [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan)

Our code is heavily based on those projects, and we are grateful for their work.
